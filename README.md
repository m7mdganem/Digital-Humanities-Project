# Gender Bias In The Knesset Committees
## Digital Humanities Project

## Project Goal 
Our goal in this project is to check equality/inequality in the Knesset Committees. 
We are seeking to see if women has the same space to speak as men in the committees.

## Digital Humanities project and the social struggle that encounters
Since there is a serious social struggle with freedom of speech of women in many fields in
the community, we want to see if the Knesset gives women the same space to speak as it gives the men.

In this project, we take a lot of messy data about the  Knesset Committees and analyze this data to see
how this  social struggle appears in the Israeli parliament. Such big data are hard to handle manually
so in this project, we use digital tools to collect and handle the data to extract from it the usefull data
we need along the project.

## Working Program 
We want to split the project into many tasks which will Include (more or less):
1. Writing automated scripts to extract the Knesset committees protocols from the Knesset government website.
2. Extracting the names of all Kenneset members that participate in the committee and save how many words each of them had spoken.
3. Search for the names of the Knesset member in the database that include all information about them including gender.
4. Translate the names of all members to English .
5. Create an object that contains all info about the member (name, gender, words spoken).
6. Build the JSON Files for each committee.
7. Build the dataset.
8. Using the dataset, we will create a visualization that represents the results of the project.

## Final Results 
After assembling all the JSON files that contain the required data we will provide the user with a
visualization that describes the data from the dataset (maybe we will provide an interactive visualization
that will let the user interact with it with some UI and get the data we gathered along the project).
